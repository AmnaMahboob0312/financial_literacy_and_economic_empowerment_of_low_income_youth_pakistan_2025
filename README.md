# financial_literacy_and_economic_empowerment_of_low_income_youth_pakistan_2025

This report explores the financial literacy of low-income youth (ages 20–25) in Islamabad, Pakistan, and its impact on their economic empowerment. Using Google Forms surveys—primarily from university students—data was cleaned, encoded, and analyzed to assess financial knowledge and decision-making confidence. Results show that while most participants understand basic budgeting, they struggle with interest rates, saving, and investing. Education shows a moderate link to financial literacy, while the correlation between financial literacy and economic empowerment is weak but positive. Past programs in Pakistan improved short-term knowledge but failed to create lasting behavioral change. The report recommends integrating financial literacy into the education system and introducing youth-focused initiatives similar to Denmark’s “Money Week.”
